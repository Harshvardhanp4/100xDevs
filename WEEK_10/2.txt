Problems:- 

1. We have to write raw SQL QUERIES
2. Migrations are hard (Migrate databases from one set of chema to another.)
3. You dont get best Types


Solution:-  ORMs (Object relational Model).\
Its a layer in middle Prisma ORM.

What Prisma provides you : -

1. Prisma Client: Type Checking
2. Prisma Migrate: To easily migrate the databases
3. Prisma Studio: - Gui to edit and view data in Databases.

Automated Migrations:- Db changes often you add columns tables , so you have to do migrations 
to keep syncing the DB state.

Pre ORM days- manually update the prod DB, dev DB
No log of changes made. ORMS help to ease this task.


 
 npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev // during only devlopment 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 model User {
    id Int @id default(autoincrement()) //increments 
    email String @unique // email must be unique
    name String? //? means optional
    posts Post[] //need to do this strict
 }

 model Post {
    id INT @id default(autoincrement())
    title String
    content String?
    published Boolean @default(false)
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id]) //every post has an author who is user, and the authorId will be the userId
    authorId Int
 }
