1. Login to AWS Console â†’ search for S3.

2. Create a bucket â†’

Choose region (e.g., ap-south-1).
keep it blocked if youâ€™ll use CloudFront OAC (recommended).

Upload frontend build files â†’ your compiled index.html, CSS, JS, images.

If React: run npm run build â†’ upload the build/ or dist folder.

Enable static website hosting (optional) â†’ In S3 â†’ Properties â†’ Static website hosting.

This gives you a direct S3 website URL (but not recommended for production).

Create a CloudFront distribution (not CloudWatch ðŸ˜… small correction):

Origin = your S3 bucket.

Use Origin Access Control (OAC) so bucket is private but CloudFront can fetch.

Copy the suggested bucket policy from CloudFront and paste into your S3 bucket policy.

Deploy â†’ Wait until CloudFront status = Deployed.

Access via CDN URL â†’ e.g., https://d123abcxyz.cloudfront.net/index.html.

You can later map your own domain via Route 53 or any DNS.
